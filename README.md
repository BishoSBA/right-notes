## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
* Materialize as my CSS framework
* Handlebars for templating the HTML
* Authentication using Passport with both Google oauth and Local Strategies
* MongoDB for the database to store the users and notes

## Optimizations

* Enable login through facebook or github accounts
* Add sorting feature to ease going through the public notes
* Add "add to collection" feature to save notes for future reference.

## Lessons Learned:

* Learned to utililize handlebars for templating
* Deploying a full-stack web application on a hosting server
* Using Materialize as a CSS Framework
